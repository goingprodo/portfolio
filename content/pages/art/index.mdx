#### Synopsis

On a climate-scorched Earth, people escape to an eco-friendly hotel for vacation. The hotel hosts a free organic supplement party—but these pills convert humans into digital data.

A duo monitoring from behind detonates the hotel as part of their experiment. Party guests transform into data one by one while the experimenters discuss memory allocation. Eventually, all humans become data, leaving only AI behind.

Through the irony that "turning humans into resources is true sustainability," the film warns of a future where technology replaces humanity.

#### Program Note

*"A work that explores the paradoxical coexistence of climate crisis and AI through retro visual language and symbolic spaces."*

From the red Earth to pink hotels, cars, volcanic eruptions, and data centers—the narrative metaphorically traces civilization's collapse and the rise of technological dominance.

The recurring pink encapsulates consumption, pleasure, crisis packaging, and AI's sweet-faced future. Ironic dialogue and music unsettle the boundaries between human, machine, and pleasure.

#### About This Work

A mechanical mother and son discuss the journey of finding the bluebird—across childhood and old age. Through desert hardships and dreamlike hope, the film explores how true happiness emerges not from external searching, but from inner transformation.

**"Life is imperfect warmth that no algorithm can explain."**

This work uses machines' perspective to tell humanity's most emotional story, inviting viewers to reflect on their own "now."
