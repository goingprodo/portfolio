## Philosophy

> "AI is not a tool, but a creative partner. New art emerges where human creativity meets machine possibilities."

I experiment at the intersection of technology and art, exploring new creative possibilities that AI opens up. Beyond simply using technology, I seek ways to think and express alongside it.

## Creative Approach

My work investigates how artificial intelligence can expand the boundaries of human expression. Through experimental video projects, I challenge conventional narratives and create immersive experiences that question our relationship with technology.

<br/>

I believe in:
- **Collaborative Creation:** Working with AI as a creative partner, not just a tool
- **Technical Poetry:** Finding beauty in algorithms and computational processes
- **Accessible Innovation:** Making advanced AI tools available to all creators
- **Ethical Exploration:** Considering the implications of AI-generated art
